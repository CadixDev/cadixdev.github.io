We write software for examining, and manipulating Java software in both binary and source
form - allowing for developers to perform large-scale refactors across their codebase, or
work with obfuscated dependencies.

We have adopted existing community standards to ensure our tools can replace legacy tooling
where appropriate, and have designed all our tooling as a stack allowing it to be used
together with ease.

Additionally, we [work with our upstream projects] to get required changes available
to all consumers of their software rather than maintaining our own set of changes where
possible.
