Vignette is a simple CLI for remapping JAR artifacts with de-obfuscation mappings -
supporting the SRG formats (except XSRG) out-of-the-box, this can be expanded
through the use of Lorenz IO packages (we have packages for Enigma, JAM, and Kin).

Vignette is primarily composed of [Atlas](atlas) and [Lorenz](lorenz), which handles
the transformation and IO respectively.

*Vignette is available for download through [GitHub Releases](release)*.
