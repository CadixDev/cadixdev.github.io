Bombe 0.3.2 and 0.4.1 resolves a critical bug when using `JarEntryRemappingTransformer` with a
manifest with no `Main-Class` attribute.

---

In a first for us, we have made bug-fixes across 2 versions of software - Bombe 0.3.x and
0.4.x. This was neccasery, as we are yet to make any releases of Lorenz and Atlas using 0.4.x.

To be clear, so long as Bombe 0.3.x is used - I will continue to make bug release fixes for it,
and I may consider back-porting new features depending on when future Lorenz and Bombe releases
will be made.
