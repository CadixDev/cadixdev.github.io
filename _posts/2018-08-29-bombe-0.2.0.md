Bombe 0.2.0 continues the Bombe mission, further working towards making a cleaner codebase
that can be used further afield than Lorenz or Survey.

Big thanks to @Minecrell, for his help towards this release!

- [Drop dependency on Guava](https://github.com/jamiemansfield/Bombe/pull/1)
- [Add PrimitiveType](https://github.com/jamiemansfield/Bombe/pull/2)
- [Refactor Field/MethodSignature constructors](https://github.com/jamiemansfield/Bombe/pull/4)

## Changes

- Parsing for Types and MethodDescriptors has been overhauled, using readers for the both. This
  provides a much cleaner solution than what existed previously - dramatically improving the
  parsing of MethodDescriptors specifically.
- The dependency on Guava has been dropped.
- A PrimitiveType interface has been introduced, providing a direct replacement for the
  PrimitiveType enum that previously existed in Lorenz.
- The 'convenience' signature constructors have been replaced with `#of(String, String)`
  methods.
