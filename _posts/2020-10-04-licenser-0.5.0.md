We have made the first release of [licenser] under the Cadix Development organisation,
which brings the project up-to-date and ready for changes being made to Gradle in 7.0.

## Usage

```gradle
plugins {
    id 'org.cadixdev.licenser' version '0.5.0'
}
```

## Future

In future, we would like to look at migrating our Gradle plugins over to Kotlin - a
type-safe language still preserving the lack of great boilerplate using Java, that
seems to be the direction that Gradle is heading towards.

This will be a good opportunity to review functionality in our plugins, and work with
our communities to resolve long-term frustrations with our projects.

A more broad goal is to introduce further configuration to allow fine-tuning of our
plugins across-the-board, sparked by [lack therefor in gitpatcher](https://github.com/CadixDev/gitpatcher/issues/4).
