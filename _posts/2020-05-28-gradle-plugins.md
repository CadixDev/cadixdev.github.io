A few weaks ago myself and Minecrell moved our collective Gradle plugins into the Cadix
Development organisation, where they will be maintained going forward:

- [licenser](https://github.com/CadixDev/licenser)
- [gitpatcher](https://github.com/CadixDev/gitpatcher)
- [ProPatcher](https://github.com/CadixDev/ProPatcher)

Going forward, releases of these plugins will be made under the `org.cadixdev` package / 
group. I will be looking at making releases to all of these plugins shortly, preparing
them for usage on modern versions of Gradle.

These plugins are used widely throughout the community (Minecraft and beyond), especially
licenser, so we would love for our communities' input on the future of these plugins.
