Bombe 0.3.5 and 0.4.4 are small releases introducing some new APIs to bolster the
capabilities of the jar transformation framework, namely allowing entries to be
introduced. To accomplish this, a `JarEntryTransformer#additions()` method has
been introduced.

The remapping transformer will additionally strip signature files and entries
in the manifest. This transformer may in future be available standalone.

## Bombe 0.3.5

The `Jars` utility has been deprecated in this version, advising consumers to
switch to Atlas. Jars was removed in 0.4.0, so this just serves as a final
notice to any lingering applications using the utility. Despite the deprecation,
support for the new additions API has been implemented.
