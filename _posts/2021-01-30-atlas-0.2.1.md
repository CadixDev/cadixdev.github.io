Atlas 0.2.1 provides some quality-of-life features designed to make Atlas more configurable and accountable.

- Execeptions will no longer be dismissed when transforming, and rather rethrown (as was my intention).
- Output jars will be repackaged to ensure that the manifest is read by JarInputStream correctly.
- Atlases can specify their own ExecutorService to use, or their parallelism level if using our provided constructors.
