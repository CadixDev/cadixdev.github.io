Atlas 0.2.0 has been developed with performance in mind, now caching classes on
demand rather than all up-front and walking based on `JarPath`s not read entries.
These changes alone, will dramatically reduce the memory footprint for many uses
of Atlas.

Jar Transforms have also been improved, running each class' tranformations in
parallel to other classes - making for a super-speedy Jar transform.

No matter where Atlas is used, Atlas 0.2.0 should provide performance and/or memory
improvements to your application!
